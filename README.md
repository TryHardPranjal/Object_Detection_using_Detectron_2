# Text_Identification_using_Detectron_2
In this notebook, we are going to deal with identifying the language of text using the Faster RCNN model from the Detectron 2's model zoo. We are going to limit our languages by 2.

We identify Hindi and English Text and we include a Single Class called Others for other languages.
